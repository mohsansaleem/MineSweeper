# MineSweeper & Roulette
**Data-Driven Game Architecture Showcase**

A technical demonstration of scalable, data-driven game architecture using Unity and C#. This project showcases production-grade patterns including MVP architecture, dependency injection, reactive programming, and object pooling—techniques refined over 10+ years developing multiplayer titles at Ubisoft and other studios.

## 🎮 Games

### Minesweeper
State-driven implementation demonstrating robust architecture patterns and clean separation of concerns. Features configurable gameplay through ScriptableObjects for rapid iteration.

### Roulette
Service-oriented design showcasing asynchronous patterns and reactive programming for external data requests and real-time updates.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Core Patterns:**
- **MVP Architecture** – Clean separation between presentation, business logic, and data
- **Dependency Injection** – Modular, testable components with reduced coupling
- **Reactive Programming** – Event-driven systems for responsive gameplay
- **Object Pooling** – Optimized memory management for mobile-scale performance
- **Data-Driven Design** – ScriptableObject-based configuration for designer-friendly iteration

**Key Technologies:**
- Unity3D (C#)
- Promises/Async patterns for non-blocking operations
- Custom serialization for efficient data handling
